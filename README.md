    scoop install forge

#### Via Homebrew (OSX)

#### Via Linuxbrew (Linux)

#### Other

You can download one of the releases found at https://github.com/fsharp-editing/Forge/releases

Alternately you can clone the repo, build the source, and then move the files in your bin folder to a location of your choosing.

##### On Linux:

One option is to build the project from source and create a symlink.

Choose an installation directory:

```bash
export BUILD_DIR=apps
mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR
cd $BUILD_DIR
```

Clone the repo and build the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fsharp-editing/Forge
cd Forge
./build.sh
```

Choose a location for the executable:

```bash
export INSTALL_DIR=~/bin
mkdir -p $INSTALL_DIR
```

Ensure that the destination directory is on the user's `$PATH`.
For example, in the user's `.bashrc`, add the following line:

```
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
```

Reload the `.bashrc` with `source` or `.`:

```bash
. ~/.bashrc
```

Create a symlink that points to the script, which runs executable.

```bash
ln -s `pwd`/temp/forge.sh $INSTALL_DIR/forge
```
